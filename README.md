# Small N Stats Tau-U Calculator (Qt)
The Tau-U Calculator is a Qt-based application that allows users working with single-case data to easily score and integrate similar data in a visual, spreadsheet-driven manner.

Features include:
  - Calculation of the Tau-U metric, as defined in Parker, R.I., Vannest, K.J., Davis, J.L., Sauber, S.B. (2010). Combining non-overlap and trend for single case research: Tau-U.Behavior Therapy. 42, 284–299. DOI: 10.1016/j.beth.2010.08.006.
  - Automated scoring of individual cases
  - Cases with multiple comparisons are combined, to allow individual-level interpretation
  - Individuals within studies or cohorts are automatically integrated, allowing study or cluster-level interpretation
  - Omnibus effect sizes provided for all cases
  - Forest plots provided for individual cases as well as cluster- and study-level outcomes
  - Easily imports common file formats into the application's spreadsheet (.xlsx)
  - Saves results in popular image and word processing formats
  - Wide range of outputs/metrics, saveable in common spreadsheet file formats
  - Cross-platform support, compilable for Windows, Mac, and Linux (only Ubuntu tested)
